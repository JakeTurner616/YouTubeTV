## üåé Languages

This readme is available in the following languages:

- üá∫üá∏ English
- üá™üá∏ [Spanish](./README.es-ES.md)

It implements a [DIAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_Launch) server (based in [SSDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol)) to allow connection from devices that use this same protocol (limited to YouTube in this application).

Use the userAgent allowed by YouTube TV:
```
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/534.24 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/11.0.696.77 Large Screen Safari/534.24 GoogleTV/092754
```
It can use ```npm start``` or else ```npx electron .``` .
If you already have electron installed globally, you can start the app with ```electron .```

## üîå Offline message ‚Äì [Last update ‚Äì 2.3.4] 
When YouTube TV loads offline, it will display a message indicating that it has been unable to connect to YouTube's servers.

When the renderer detects connectivity, it will try again.

## üîß Configuration

YouTube TV now includes a window for configuring the maximum playback resolution.

This window can be opened by pressing the keys <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

Resolution has been limited from the developing environment for the following reason:

Nowadays the mayority of computers are provided with integrated graphics, i.e. they share memory with the rest of the system, different to discrete graphic cards, which include their own memory modules where they have an isolated storage space without external load.

This implies more workload for the processor, and there are cases where resolutions above 2K/4K begin to affect performance at exagereted level.

Obviously the final user can establish the resolution they prefer; nevertheless, YouTube is able to measure bandwith and automatically establish the best resolution available in relation with bandwith, which can be bothering, since frequently hardware capacities aren't enough to reproduce those resolutions that high.
