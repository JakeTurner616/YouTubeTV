## üåé Languages

This readme is available in the following languages:

- üá∫üá∏ English ([alealclag](https://github.com/alealclag))
- üá™üá∏ [Spanish](./README.es-ES.md) (marcosrg9)

It implements a [DIAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_Launch) server (based in [SSDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol)) to allow connection from devices that use this same protocol (limited to YouTube in this application).

Use the userAgent allowed by YouTube TV:
```

```
It can use ```npm start``` or else ```npx electron .``` .
If you already have electron installed globally, you can start the app with ```electron .```

## üîÑ Latest update (2.2.1)

Latest update includes various upgrades:
- Up to 8K resolution support. ([Limited to 4K by default](#üîß-Configuration))
- Background playback support.
- UX upgrade.
- Server resistant to occupied ports.
- Security patches.

## Detailed report

- A resolution simulation system has been implemented. Now YouTube TV can simulate a resolution higher than the screen's to not have the maximum resolutions limited by the platform to the truncated ones.

- A serious bug has been fixed that didn't let the server initialize when the port was occupied. Now it will try to initialize at the default port (2000), and if this is already occupied, it will try again as many times as needed with random ports.

- Now YouTube TV enters fullscreen mode automatically when a device is connected and exits when is disconnected.

- YouTube TV is now able to play content in background even when losing focus. This was being triggered by a visibility change event that the own platform was listening to. This event has been canceled.

- Electron updated to version 13.2.1.

- Solved Security bugs:
    - [CVE-2021-23343](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hj48-42vr-x3v9)
    - [CVE-2021-33502](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-px4h-xg32-q955)
    - [CVE-2021-33623](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7p7h-4mm5-852v)
    - [CVE-2021-23362](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-43f8-2h32-f4cj)
    - [CVE-2021-23337](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-35jh-r3h4-6jhm)

## ‚õî Known problems

- If a queue is generated and then another user gets connected (the already connected user gets kicked out), the queue is removed. This is not the expected behaviour, but it's something inevitable, it seems to be the normal way of working on the YouTube TV platform.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tests

- ‚úÖ Windows 10 x64 - win32_x64/ia32.
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu 19.04 x64 (VM) - linux_x64.
- ‚úÖ macOS 11.4 Big Sur (MacBook Air) - darwin_x64 (Marcos).
- ‚úÖ macOS 11.2.3 Big Sur (MacBook Air) - darwin_x64 (Marcos).
- ‚úÖ macOS 11.1 Big Sur (MacBook Air) - darwin_x64 ([Mateo Fortea](https://github.com/mfortea)).
- ‚úÖ Rasbian 10 Buster (Raspberry Pi 4 B+) - linux_armv7l.

Not tested on Windows and macOS for ARM platforms, except for ARM Linux for Raspberry (armv7l).

## üîß Configuration

YouTube TV now includes a window for configuring the maximum playback resolution.

This window can be opened by pressing the keys <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

</div>
Resolution has been limited from the developing environment for the following reason:

Nowadays the mayority of computers are provided with integrated graphics, i.e. they share memory with the rest of the system, different to discrete graphic cards, which include their own memory modules where they have an isolated storage space without external load.

This implies more workload for the processor, and there are cases where resolutions above 2K/4K begin to affect performance at exagereted level.

Obviously the final user can establish the resolution they prefer; nevertheless, YouTube is able to measure bandwith and automatically establish the best resolution available in relation with bandwith, which can be bothering, since frequently hardware capacities aren't enough to reproduce those resolutions that high.
